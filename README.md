## Acknowledgements
We extend our thanks to the following:

- **React**: This project is built using the React library, an open-source JavaScript library maintained by Facebook. The React community's dedication to providing a powerful and efficient front-end development experience is invaluable.

- **Font Awesome-icons**: We leverage the icon font toolkit provided by Font Awesome. Their `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` package enhances our project's visual appeal with a wide variety of scalable icons.

- **React Router-dom**: A big thank you to the maintainers and contributors of `react-router-dom` for making navigation in React applications smooth and intuitive.

- **Axios**: We appreciate the simplicity and effectiveness of Axios, a promise-based HTTP client. Axios has streamlined our data fetching and API communication, contributing to the project's overall success.

- **react-redux**: React Redux is a library that provides centralized state management for React applications. It helps in managing complex state logic by maintaining a global store accessible to any component. Redux follows a predictable pattern for state updates, ensuring consistency and ease of debugging. Additionally, it promotes separation of concerns by keeping state management separate from presentation logic, enhancing code maintainability and testability.

- **react-toastify**:is a React library that simplifies the creation of toast notifications. It allows developers to easily display brief messages to users, providing feedback or updates in a non-intrusive manner.

- **redux-thunk**:  is a Redux middleware enabling asynchronous operations in action creators by allowing them to return functions instead of plain objects. This facilitates managing side effects like asynchronous API requests and coordinating multiple actions within Redux applications.

- **Swiper**:Swiper is a popular JavaScript library for creating touch-enabled, responsive carousels and sliders in web applications. It provides a robust and customizable solution for creating interactive and mobile-friendly slideshows with smooth transitions and swipe gestures.

These dependencies have significantly contributed to the success and functionality of our project. We extend our gratitude to the developers and communities behind these technologies.
